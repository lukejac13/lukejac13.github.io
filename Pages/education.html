          <h2>Computer Science</h2>
            <li><b>COMP-151: Intro to Programming</b> (Fall 2022)
              <br>
            Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to continued studies in Computer Science. Students will work with the Phython programming language in order to solve basic problems involving digital media: text, images, and sound. By the end of the course students will be able to read and develop computer programs utilizing the following programming concepts: basic data types and encoding, variables and scope, array and list data structures, if statements and conditional execution, loops and iteration, functions, and object types
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>COMP-152: Data Structures and Algorithms</b> (Spring 2023)
              <br>
              A continuation of COMP 151 that explores the essential data structures and algorithms of modern computing, including lists, stacks, queues, heaps, and trees. Students will design, analyze, and build Python programs that implement and utilize these data structures to solve computational problems, including a thorough survey of sorting and search algorithms. These theoretical constructs are complemented by exposure to good software development practices, including data abstraction via abstract data types and object-oriented software design. Strong emphasis is put on analyzing and evaluating how implementation choices made by the programmer impact overall program performance and maintainability.

            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>COMP-235: Intro to Systems Programming</b> (Fall 2023)
              <br>
              An introduction to low-level programming and computer hardware organization from a software perspective emphasizng how application programmers can use knowledge of the entire system to write better programs. Introduces C and assembly language. Core topics include data representation, machine language, the memory hierarchy, and vitural memory. Further potential topics include processor architecture, code optimization, and concurrency.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Comp-240: Computer Applications</b> (Spring 2024)
              <br>
              In Computer Applications students will work in small groups to develop three different computer applications. Each application will expose them to a different computer platform along with the tools and computing concepts used in development programs for that platform. The platform and purpose of each application will vary from year to year and instructor to instructor, but common choices of platforms include: the command line interface, the web, mobile devices, and high-performance computing. Students will maintain and develop their projects using GitHub or GitLab and Git version control software. Students will also engage in peer-review of the work of their team members and the other development teams in the course. Upon completing the course students will know how to apply basic software engineering practices in a small group setting, how to maintain software through the Git version control system, and have experience with tools and best-practices for developing modern software applications for three different computer platforms.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>COMP-337: Computer Communications</b> (Spring 2024)
              <br>
              This course introduces the fundamentals of computer networks. It focuses on the communication protocols used in computer networks, their functionality, specification, verification, implementation, and performance. The course also considers the use of network architectures and protocol hierarchies to provide more complex services. Existing protocols and architectures will be used as the basis of discussion and study.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><b>COMP-310: Database Theory and Design</b> (Fall 2024)
              <br>
              An introduction to the concepts and techniques of database systems. Includes history and motivation of database systems, data modeling, rational database, SQL, transaction processing, distributed databases.
            </li>
