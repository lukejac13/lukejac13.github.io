  <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://lukejac13.github.io/SudokuSolver/'>Sudoku Solver</a>
  <p>A simple Sudoku Solver that I first created in C++ as a command line application with no frontend UI back in 2018. Then, recently, after learning Webpage development and JavaScript implementation,
    I created the same application but within a webpage, and worked to get a UI to go with the code, to make it easier for the user to use.

  <a target = '_blanl' href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/179542184/">Political Clicker</a>
  <p>
    Back in 8th grade, for a school project, we had to make a game on Scratch. I decided to create a simple clicker game, where you you click the screen to gain votes, and as you gain votes, you
    can spend those votes to get elected as higher positions within the government, and work your way up to becoming the president of the United States. I was extremely proud of this project, 
    doing all of the artwork myself and spending a lot of time on it to ensure that it was fully functioning, and it may not seem like alot, but back then, it was a huge project for me.
